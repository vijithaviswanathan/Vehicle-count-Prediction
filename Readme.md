Predicting vehicle counts is a crucial aspect of traffic management and urban planning. The project aims to forecast the number of vehicles passing through specific locations or segments of roads over a defined period. This prediction is essential for optimizing traffic flow, scheduling maintenance, predicting congestion, and improving overall transportation efficiency.

## Key components :

 1.Data Collection: Gathered historical data on vehicle counts, which may include traffic cameras, sensors embedded in roads, or manual counts.

 2.Feature Selection: Identified relevant factors influencing vehicle counts such as time of day, day of the week, weather conditions, road conditions, events, and holidays.

 3.Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis, handled the missing values, outliers, and formated the data into a suitable structure for modeling.

 4.Model Selection: By Choosing appropriate predictive models such as time series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, SARIMA), machine learning algorithms (e.g., regression, random forests), or deep learning models (e.g., LSTM neural networks) based on the nature of the data and prediction requirements.

 5.Model Training: Trained the selected models on the historical data to learn patterns and relationships between input variables (features) and vehicle counts.

 6.Model Evaluation: Assessed the performance of the models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) to ensure accuracy and reliability.

 7.Deployment: Implemented the trained model into a real-time or near-real-time prediction system that can provide forecasts of vehicle counts for future time intervals.
